In [computational number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_number_theory "Computational number theory"), the **index calculus algorithm** is a [probabilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic "Probabilistic") [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") for computing [discrete logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm "Discrete logarithm"). Dedicated to the discrete logarithm $\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} /q\mathbb {Z} )^{*}$where ${\displaystyle q}$ is a prime, index calculus leads to a family of algorithms adapted to finite fields and to some families of elliptic curves. 
The algorithm collects relations among the discrete logarithms of small primes, computes them by a linear algebra procedure and finally expresses the desired discrete logarithm with respect to the discrete logarithms of small primes.
