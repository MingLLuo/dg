As a programmer, we usually need to organize our knowledge base, which flies out many choices.
- Writing a blog to share ideas, where you can share daily life or some technical skills.
- Doing public speech, sharing your insight about a special motif.
- Collecting what you learn in a big repository, with structural indexes, and important highlights. 

When we are explaining a concept, try to clarify it in our tone.

### Tools I used/using
- Notion
	- I adore the flexibility notion gives to the user, such as the multiple layout styles of images, as the concept of notes database and other inner functions
	- It will be my first choice of Blog System, assisted by [NotionNext](https://github.com/tangly1024/NotionNext)
- Obsidian/Typora
	- My local notes repository
	- Different themes can be chosen, as well as playability with custom codes.
	- Affluent plugin ecosystem
- Jekyll/Hexo/...
	- Banned in my list
	- These are the first infrastructure I used for building my blog, before meeting NotionNext
- Git/Github
	- maintain commit history with clear timelines
	- sync local documents to the cloud
- Vercel
	- Deploy project in static pages
	- Can use personal domains
