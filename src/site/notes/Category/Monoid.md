#Catagory
In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, a monoid isÂ **a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element**.

A monoid is a single object category. In fact the name monoid comes from Greek *mono*, which means single.

Every monoid can be described as a single object category with a set of morphisms that follow appropriate rules of composition.
